I this solved problem for SIZE = 7 but you can change it

My solution uses Sherman - Morisson formula and Givens rotation.
It is very important, reduces complexity from O(N^3) to O(N)

Detailed descritpion of my program is in polish language in the comments.

This is one of the programs written by me from numerical methods.
