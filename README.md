# Tridiagonal matrix with corners

system of equations:

| 4 1 0 0 0 0 1 |   |x1|   |1|   
| 1 4 1 0 0 0 0 |   |x2|   |2|
| 0 1 4 1 0 0 0 |   |x3|   |3|
| 0 0 1 4 1 0 0 | * |x4| = |4|
| 0 0 0 1 4 1 0 |   |x5|   |5|
| 0 0 0 0 1 4 1 |   |x6|   |6|
| 1 0 0 0 0 1 4 |   |x7|   |7|

I this solved problem for SIZE = 7 but you can change it

My solution uses Sherman - Morisson formula and Givens rotation.
It is very important, reduces complexity from O(N^3) to O(N)

Detailed descritpion of my program is in polish language in the comments.

This is one of the programs written by me from numerical methods.
